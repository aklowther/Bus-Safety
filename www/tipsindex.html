<h3>Safety:</h3>
 
<p>
	1.) On longer trips, it is a good idea to have someone as a travel mate. Remember there are safety in numbers.<br><br>
 
	2.) It is better to keep your opinion to your self and avoid conflict. Many people will say things you might not agree with.<br><br>
	 
	3.) Be polite. Treat people with respect.<br><br>
	 
	4.) Keep bags zipped and your belongings secure.<br><br>
	 
	5.) Be aware of emergency exits.
</p>
 
<h3>Comfort:</h3>
 
<p>
	1.) Do not sit near the restroom or at the back of the bus. The smell of the restroom or the drone of the engine may cause discomfort.<br><br>
 
	2.) Bring a blanket and a travel pillow. Bus companies keep their buses cold to reduce spread of germs. <br><br>
	 
	3.) Use the restroom at rest stops. The restrooms on the bus are not always the most sanitary.<br><br>
	 
	4.) Pack earplugs or headphones. There may be sounds you wish to block out to make your trip more enjoyable. <br><br>
	 
	5.) Pack snacks. Depending on the length of your trip, the bus may or may not stop when you are hungry.
